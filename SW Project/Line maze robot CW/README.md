# Line maze robot

### Title
Line maze robot

### Project Type
Team project

### Role
To implement DFS algorithm

### Dates
Mar 2019

### Description
#### Project Overview
This project centered on the creation of an autonomous robot powered by a Raspberry Pi, designed to navigate through predetermined paths. The robot was tasked with two primary objectives: navigating out of mazes and competing in speed and accuracy in line tracing against other robots. The core challenge lay in the robot's ability to autonomously make decisions when encountering diverging paths or obstacles, necessitating the implementation of an efficient algorithm for maze solving and line tracing.

#### Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi: Served as the control unit of the robot, running the Python-based software that implemented the DFS algorithm and processed input from the sensors.
- Sensors: A variety of sensors were employed, including infrared sensors for line detection and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and distance measurement.
- Software: The project made extensive use of Python for programming the Raspberry Pi, chosen for its robust libraries and ease of integration with hardware components.

#### Challenges and Learnings
Throughout the project, several challenges were encountered, including optimizing the DFS algorithm for speed, improving sensor accuracy, and ensuring reliable performance in diverse conditions. Key learnings included the importance of thorough testing, the value of iterative design, and insights into the integration of hardware and software to solve complex real-world problems.

#### Conclusion
This project not only demonstrated the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi in controlling autonomous robots but also provided valuable insights into algorithm implementation, sensor integration, and real-time problem solving. The success of the robot in both maze solving and line tracing competitions highlights the potential of combining traditional algorithms with modern hardware for practical applications.
