# Data Mining Coursework

### Title
Flight status prediction

### Project Type
Team project (Coursework)

### Role
To predict the flight status using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm

### Dates
Mar 2023 - May 2023

### Description
This project focuses on predicting arrival flight delays using machine learning and deep learning approaches. The goal is to classify flight delays into five categories: small delay, medium delay, large delay, cancelled, and on-time, based on various features related to flight information. 

The dataset used in this project is the Flight Status Prediction dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about aviation delays for domestic airlines within the USA from 2018 to 2022. The dataset for the year 2022 was chosen, consisting of around 4 million training instances, for this project.
